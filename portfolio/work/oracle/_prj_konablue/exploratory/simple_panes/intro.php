		This is a quick framework for testing how we want the different areas of 
		the app to interact, and what content goes into the content area. The idea
		is that we will continue to build pieces into this framework in order to
		test the interaction model and content display, so this is by no means
		final.
	</p>
	<p>
		Please take a moment to play with the different areas of the app that are 
		active and put together your thoughts on:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>What content to display, and wehn</li>
		<li>How does the interaction feel</li>
		<li>What, if anything, is missing or broken</li>
		<li>General thoughts and comments</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
