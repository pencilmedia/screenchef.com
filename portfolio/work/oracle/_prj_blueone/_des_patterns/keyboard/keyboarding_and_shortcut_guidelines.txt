>> OVERVIEW
************************************************

It is the intent of the Agile application design to allow power users to keep their hands on the keyboard to complete their tasks.  This allows users to complete their tasks in a productive manner.  However, there are significant challenges to keyboarding and keyboard shortcut support due to the limitations of, and conflicts with, web browsers and operating systems.  This document provides:
 
- guidelines to follow when defining keyboard interactions 
- a list of all current keyboard shortcuts

    
TERMINOLOGY:
Keyboarding = user completing tasks in the application using their keyboard without using other devices such as their mouse
Tabbing = using TAB (SHIFT + TAB), ENTER and ESC to move focus within application pages and execute functions
Shortcuts = a key, combination of keys, combination of keys and pointer device that execute a specific function  



************************************************
>> GENERAL GUIDELINES
************************************************

1. "Tabbing" allows users to move focus across major UI elements on a page and execute key functions.  This basic level of keyboard interaction must be supported for all features.  Any exceptions must be called out within this document, as this is the base level of keyboard support.

2. Additional keyboard "shortcuts" are used for optimizing user productivity for **high value, repetitive tasks**.  Be very judicious when adding accelerators.  Limiting accelerators:

- avoids confusing users with an endless list of Agile shortcuts
- makes best use of keyboard combinations available to us
- avoids conflicts with browser keyboard shortcuts



************************************************
>> TABBING GUIDELINES
************************************************

When defining Tabbing rules use these guidelines:

- Use TAB to move the focus across major UI elements on a page
- Use TAB to move focus 'onto' a tree or menu component, but not within the tree or menu component
-- Use ARROW keys to move focus within a tree or menu UI component  
- When using TAB to move focus within a UI control (e.g. Date Picker), tabbing will be a closed loop within the control.  The user must exit the control to begin tabbing UI elements



************************************************
>> SHORTCUT GUIDELINES
************************************************

To add a shortcut for a function it must:

- be a repetitive task/action
- be found in many places in Agile UI
- significantly increase efficiency, productivity, convenience

When assigning keyboard combinations to an accelerator follow these guidelines: 

- use CTRL as the primary modifier (e.g. CTRL + L to launch palette)
- SHIFT can be used in conjunction with CTRL
- a single character can be used, but ensure that input fields won't interfere with its desired behavior
- be consistent with user's mental model of what seems sensible
- be consistent across contexts like form and table, for instance
- keep in mind existing keyboard combinations for Agile 9.x products and leverage them as appropriate

- DO NOT use ALT
- DO NOT use CMD for the Mac
- DO NOT use + or - (DEL or Backspace to be evaluated)
- DO NOT use common browser and OS combinations (e.g. CTRL + S for Save).  exceptions for special cases only 

NOTE: For some UI components we will need to suppress / override the contextual menu on Macs in order to reduce accelerator conflicts.  This currently will apply to all table and tree components

************************************************

-----------------------------
GENERIC TABBING
-----------------------------

TAB	     =  move focus ahead
SHIFT + TAB  =  move focus back
ENTER	     =  executes function with focus


-----------------------------
TABBING - UI CONTROLS
-----------------------------

TAB	     =  move focus ahead within control
SHIFT + TAB  =  move focus back within control
ENTER	     =  executes function with focus and commits changes.  may close control
ESC	     =  cancels edits and closes ui control, returning focus to previous ui element


-----------------------------

-----------------------------

TAB	     =  move focus ahead within dialog
SHIFT + TAB  =  move focus back within dialog
ENTER	     =  executes function with focus


-----------------------------

-----------------------------
The following Shortcuts can be used from any location on a page and are not specific to a component or location.
