To call the coqsoft table (please change info path as necessary):

Tags you can touch:

<Color /> - http://treegrid.com/TreeGrid5_0/Doc/TreeGridXmlStyles.htm#Colors
Coqsoft uses RGB to create colors on columns, rows and headers
- Default: the color of all cells and you can specify that classed cells be another color later


<Cols /> - http://treegrid.com/TreeGrid5_0/Doc/TreeGridXmlCols.htm#C
<C /> is one column and has a variety of attributes.
The only ones you'll ever likely need are:
- Name - mandatory value of how you refer to each column.  
In our table, every cell in one column uses one frame type.  
So, I've defined the frame type here within the name.
The frame types are:
- noedit
- textbox (text input)
- multitext (textarea)
- dropdown (select)
- uom (unit of measurement: text input and select)
Name each column in order: col01[frame type], col02[frame type], ...
All columns have the atttribute CanEdit="0"

<B /> <I /> - http://treegrid.com/TreeGrid5_0/Doc/TreeGridXmlRows.htm#I
<I /> - This is one row; you can have many
The attributes are called by column name; For instance attr col01textbox would indicate Row N, Col N and by default it is blank (if not written)
To give it a value, write the attr and equal it to a value.  Remember there are various other attributes you can use to maipulate what you see in Row N, Col N

<Header /> - http://treegrid.com/TreeGrid5_0/Doc/TreeGridXmlCols.htm#Header
Important: All columns must be named here.  If you want to leave column name blank just use don't write anything in quotes.
To name columns, use format of attributes: col01[frame type] = "[text]"
