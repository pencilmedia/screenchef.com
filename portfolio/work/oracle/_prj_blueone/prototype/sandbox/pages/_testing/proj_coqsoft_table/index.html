<h1>How to Style the Coqsoft Table</h1>

<p>
	Follow these simple instructions to make the Coqsoft table
	conform to Agile's BlueOne look and feel. Style changes are
	confined to three files: agile.gif, agile.css and your table's
	XML configuration file.
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		agile.gif - By default, Coqsoft includes Grid.gif to retrieve the
		icons that make up its toolbar. Agile.gif is a modification of Grid.gif
		that removes the ugly icons for row selection and deletion.
	</li>
	<li>
		agile.css - This CSS overrides some of the styles defined in Coqsoft's
		required Grid.css file. This file must be included <i>after</i> Grid.css.
	</li>
	<li>
		XML configuration file - This is the XML configuration required by every
		Coqsoft table. You'll need to copy and paste a snippet of configuration
		code to your table's XML file.
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	<a href="table.html">Table.html</a> and <a href="table.xml">table.xml</a> are
	provided as an example on how to stylize the
	Coqsoft table. You'll need to follow these 3 steps:
</p>

<ol>
	<li>Verify that agile.css and agile.gif are in Coqsoft's Grid folder (the folder
		containing Grid.css). If the files aren't there, copy them into this
		folder.
	</li>
	<li>Copy and paste the XML snippet delimited by the BEGIN and END comments
		to your XML configuration file. The XML here will do the job of setting colors,
		hiding the bottom toolbar, removing icons, etc.
	</li>
	<li>In your HTML file, link to agile.css after linking to Grid.css.
	</li>
</ol>

<p>
	That's it! These instructions represent the current state of the Coqsoft table's
	BlueOne makeover. I'll be updating these steps as I continue to make progress.

<h1>Understanding Coqsoft's Grid.css</h1>
<p>
	Some of the BlueOne style changes are achieved by overriding Coqsoft's default styles.
	These overrides are found in agile.css. The diagram below will help you understand these
	style definitions as well as facilitate the inclusion of additional styles that might be needed:
