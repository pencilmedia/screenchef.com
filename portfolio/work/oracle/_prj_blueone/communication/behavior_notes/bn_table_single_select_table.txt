UI COMPONENT DEFINITION:
This is for selecting a single data value, replacing any currently existing data value in a table cell. The opposite of the multi-select list control. Can be found in any table as needed. 

Limits:

Dependencies:

Default width:




TERMINOLOGY:

Edit Div: the editable view of the MSL content, with full MSL controls

Type-In Area: the text field for typing in values

Launch Button: for launching the search palette for MSL

Pill Area: contains the pills

Pill: a confirmed/validated data value that can be selected as a single entity

Focus: The normal browser notion of focus. Will allow events to fire relative to the object that has the focus.

Selection: Add the element that received an event to a collection of objects for code to operate on.

Visual Selection: A visual cue to the user that demonstrates the selected state of an object.




UI LAYOUT:

In table cell:
- the text is justified left within table cell
- data values separated by semicolon
- text truncated per browser abilities
- text revealed/hidden per table column resizing (see table_behavior_notes.txt)


In edit div:
- type-in area is above the pill area
- text in the area is justified left
- launch button is to the right of the type-in area
- auto-completion list appears below the type-in area, temporarily obscuring the pill area
- text is justified left in auto-completion list
- pills occupy the pill area accordingly

Positioning:
If on the far Right column:
- UOM, datepicker, MSL, and multitext all move in leftward so nothing is jutting outside of the table frame

If on the bottom row:
- multitext read and edit div goes upward from the cell
- MSL read div goes upward from the cell
- datepicker calendar appears above the cell when the button is pressed
- MSL edit div and single-select search goes upward


VISUAL DISPLAY:
table_actions.psd



ICONOGRAPHY: 
- search palette icon for the button: 16 x 16 pixels
- pill close button: 10 x 10 pixels

------------------------------
IN GENERAL...
------------------------------

MOUSE ACTIONS:

- CLICK on a cell: cell is highlighted
- DOUBLE-CLICK on a cell: full single-select search controls appear with the single pill and pill area
- CLICK search button to launch the palette
- CLICK off the edit div = ESC


KEYBOARD COMMANDS:

- TAB: puts focus on cell, visually selected
- ENTER: UI control appears  (same as DOUBLE-CLICK above)
- ENTER again: confirms search selection, UI controls disappear, focus on current cell
- ESC: discards changes, and shows the cell with prior data, focus on current cell
- ARROW UP/DOWN: puts focus on above/below cell

keyboarding within single-select control:

TAB INDEX ORDER:

- across cells: horizontally, left to right, then down to the next row

- within MSL control: >> see single_select_search_behavior_notes.doc (by Michele)


DEFAULT STATES:

- Edit Div default size: see PSD file


SYSTEM BEHAVIORS: n/a

- All keyboard commands above; Ben/centralized keyboard list
- Any system behaviors not foreseen yet?

- How to handle Search Palette: where does it appear in relation to the Edit Div/MSL controls

Email thread with Ben Listwon, 6/26/07, re: search palettes

- what happens to the search palette upon focus change to:
-- a totally different table cell data type
-- different table cell but same data type (eg, in the same column, arrowing up/down)

I say we kill it on switch, for reasons covered yesterday (too busy, reload time, etc etc)
[uday: agree]


- what if user tries to drag search results from the palette to the read state of the MSL cell? 
[uday: flip it to edit state]

This is another reason I think that thing should close when a field is switched,
or you go from edit back to view.


- can we have more than one search palette shown at once? (eg, from a different table cell with MSL or user search, etc.)
[uday: NO]

Same as above.
