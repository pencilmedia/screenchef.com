Left Pane: Behavior Notes
Updated 5/31/07

The Left Pane is defined as the sidebar on the left of the main content, including the splitter & collapser that divide the Left Pane from main content.  The Left Pane provides users immediate access to:

- Administrative Actions (Split Pane, Tools, Help and Exit)
- Folders, Reports and the Navigator, etc. (specific content sections TBD per Agile product modules/components)
- Accordion-style Interactions
 

NOTE: Some of the interactions and functionality of Left Pane are dependent upon MDI interactions, which are still being drafted in MDI_behavior_notes.txt (ongoing for Sprint 3)


KEYBOARDING
---------------
- TAB/SHIFT-TAB across the Left Pane elements
-- Start at open drawer
-- Down the left pane for each major element
-- Tab-able elements include drawers, tree roots (or first tree value), and left pane buttons 

- ENTER will activate the focus element, according to that elements behaviors
- Other keyboard controls will behave according to defined behaviors for those elements.  For example, when a tree is in focus, the keyboard controls defined for a tree will be observed

- When a drawer content area is in focus...
-- ARROW UP/DOWN will vertically scroll the contents of the drawer
-- ARROW LEFT/RIGHT will horizontal scroll the content area of the drawer 

- TBD - Keyboard control to expand/collapse the left pane
- TBD - To open a drawer


COLLAPSER (shark gills)
---------------
- CLICK: collapse/expand the left pane to the last remembered width
- Selected drawer is remembered upon collapse/expand
- The state of trees will be remembered upon collapse/expand



SPLITTER
---------------
- HOVER: show pane splitter cursor
- No color change on hover of the splitter

- CLICK + DRAG: show pane splitter cursor
- CLICK + DRAG: anywhere along the splitter

- min width: none
- max width: none
- default width: 200 px



LOGO
---------------
- PNG image that can be replaced by customer
- TBD: Replacement will be a simple action from the Themes Admin page
- Background is constant



ADMINISTRATIVE ACTIONS 
---------------

- follow the button notes for the hover states, etc
- Note: icons may change

ACCORDION BEHAVIOR
------------------
- One drawer is selected at all times
- Only one drawer can be selected at any one time (ie, can't have two drawers open at once)
- DEFAULT is Folders in prototype
- DEFAULT in final product per PM request (BJC> suggest folders on first instance and last setting on subsequent instances)

- When drawer is selected, its focus is in a way to allow immediate arrow UP/DOWN for scrolling

- See prototype for hex values of Selected, Unselected drawer states
- CLICK unselected drawer to open it (drawer moves up)
- CLICK a different drawer to open it (new drawer moves up, closing the previous drawer)
- NO toggling: if user clicks a selected drawer, nothing happens
- Vertical scrolling allowed within an open drawer (BJC> please ensure it works with mouse wheel on ALL platforms, browsers.)
- Horizontal scrolling allowed within an open drawer, particularly with Trees (BJC> please ensure it works with mouse wheel on ALL platforms, browsers.)
- Drawer and section names should be short; avoid long names
- Selected drawer is remembered upon collapse/expand of left pane splitter


DRAWER TEXT
------------------
- Drawer names in ALL CAPS
- Section names within drawers in mixed case
