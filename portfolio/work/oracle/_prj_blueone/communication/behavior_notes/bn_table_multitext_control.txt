UI COMPONENT DEFINITION:
Multi-text is an alphanumeric text input box that allows for multiple lines of text to be inputted, within a table cell. It can accept alphanumeric characters per specific field constraints. It is NOT the single line text field. Can be found in any table as needed. 

Limits:
Display width is set in admin, irrespective of character max

Dependencies: 
Input frame width increase/decrease as user resizes the column (see table_behavior_notes.txt)

Default width:




TERMINOLOGY:

Read-only Div: the expanded read-only view of the table cell contents, extends beyond the table cell borders, with a vertical scroll as needed

Edit Div: the the editable view of the multi-text content

Text Box: the multi-line text entry box that scrolls vertically as needed, and wraps text to the next line per character limits

Focus: The normal browser notion of focus. Will allow events to fire relative to the object that has the focus.

Selection: Add the element that received an event to a collection of objects for code to operate on.

Visual Selection: A visual cue to the user that demonstrates the selected state of an object.




UI LAYOUT:

In table cell:
- the text is justified left within table cell
- data values separated by semicolon
- data truncated per browser abilities
- data revealed/hidden per table column resizing (see table_behavior_notes.txt)


In read-only div:
- the text is justified left within read-only div
- text wraps per browser abilities within div space
- vertical scrolling allowed
- no horizontal scrolling


In edit div:
- the text box (with vertical scrolling as needed) is within the div (horizontally and vertically)
- text wraps per browser abilities within div space
- vertical scrolling allowed
- text is justified left within text box
- no horizontal scrolling



Positioning:
If on the far Right column:
- UOM, datepicker, MSL, and multitext all move in leftward so nothing is jutting outside of the table frame

If on the bottom row:
- multitext read and edit div goes upward from the cell
- MSL read div goes upward from the cell
- datepicker calendar appears above the cell when the button is pressed
- MSL edit div and single-select search goes upward

************************************************
>> BEHAVIORS
************************************************
------------------------------
IN GENERAL...
------------------------------

MOUSE ACTIONS: 

- CLICK on a cell: cell is highlighted, read-only div visible after 2 second delay
- DOUBLE-CLICK shows the edit div, with a text box, text selected, scroll down to the end of the text selection (end of text string)
- upon DOUBLE-CLICK, all text is visually selected and in focus, and the cursor is at the end by default per CPD feedback
- also upon DOUBLE-CLICK, what's shown is the "last part" of the text, since the cursor is at the end
- CLICK off the read-only div = ESC
- CLICK off the edit div = ESC


KEYBOARD COMMANDS:
(note: these are subject to change per prototype feedback)

- TAB: puts focus on cell, and shows the read-only div after 2 second delay (equal to CLICK above)
- ENTER: flips to edit div (equal to DOUBLE-CLICK above)
- SHIFT + ENTER does carriage return in edit div (NEED TO DISCUSS)
- ENTER: keeps changes made, and shows the cell with new data
- ESC: discards changes, and shows the cell with prior data
- ARROW UP/DOWN: puts focus on cell, and shows the read-only div (equal to CLICK above)

- Use browser-defined behaviors for text input area (ARROW, HOME, PAGE DOWN, PAGE UP, END, etc.




TAB INDEX ORDER:

- across cells: horizontally, left to right, then down to the next row
- within edit div: browser focus is on text scroll box, can't tab to Close Box (requires mouse click)




DEFAULT STATES:

- Upon entering edit div, any text contents are visually selected and in focus, ready for editing via keyboard
- Cursor is placed at the end of text block
- WRAP text to the next line as user types in text box, per character limits
- If text extends beyond cell width, show the end part of the text upon DOUBLE-CLICK, where the cursor is, at the end

- Edit Div default size: see PSD file
- Text box default size: see PSD file




SYSTEM BEHAVIORS: n/a


------------------------------
READ DIV
------------------------------
- ARROW UP/DOWN to scroll thru the text block
- ESC to dismiss the div and see just the table cell as usual
- ARROW UP/DOWN or TAB to move focus to a different table cell


------------------------------
EDIT DIV
------------------------------

- appears on DOUBLE-CLICK or ENTER
- default Div size: TBD

- default focus in edit div is text input box
- if any text already entered, this text is highlighted upon DOUBLE-CLICK of table cell
- text highlight color is defaulted per OS/browser
- ENTER: clears text and dismisses the edit div, shows change to the visually selected table cell, preserves focus & visual selection on that table cell
- carriage return: SHIFT + ENTER
- ESC: discards changes, and shows the cell with prior data
- CLICK off the edit div = ESC

- A character counter is located centered below the text box, counting down the number of characters the user can write
- The color of the character counter changes to red at a specific percentage level (TBD)
