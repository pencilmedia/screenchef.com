Table Errors and Warnings
updated by Uday Gajendar
on 12/03/2007


- User adds objects to the table (regardless of method)
- User clicks Save to validate
- Table area refreshes
- And at the same time:

-- DMS strip appears at top saying there are warnings and/or errors, gives the total number found with a More link for the logfile dialog window
-- First impacted table row is SELECTED by default
-- Div message for that selected row appears just below the impacted row in a callout look (obscuring the other rows, per PSD mockup)
-- Any other table rows with errors and warnings are highlighted per Photoshop mockup

[ Question: where is the browser focus after validation (save)? in the div message area (on the first clickable thing, like Accept button or checkbox or multi-error navigator arrow) OR on the first table data cell of the row being impacted? ] Ben says: Since the div is primary importance, then focus should be in that div and preferably on the Accept button if there is one. If not, then put it on the Next button. If user presses the Close X or presses ESC, then focus returns to the table, the first cell of that row. 

- Warning/error message in the div is limited by number of characters, 300 chars (approx). If message is longer, then have More link just like in DMS that opens a dialog box with full message text (see messaging behavior notes)


** Row Handle Icons: (final visuals in SVN)
- Warning icon: indicates this impacted row has warnings
- Error icon : indicates this impacted row has errors
- Addressed icon: indicates user has addressed the issue for that row

** Order of precedence:
- Error beats Warning icon
- Warning beats Addressed icon

- Thus, depending on the combination of situations for a single row, show the row handle icon per the precedence above

** the addressed icon: 
-- a row with the addressed icon has the same highlighting as rows with the warning or error icon in the row handle (dark pink when selected, light pink when unselected, until user corrects the row and saves)


** Editing table cells:


- Double-click any cell in the impacted row to edit
- Standard table keyboarding is allowed
- User can tab laterally across cells for a row
- Single-click or tab to a cell in the impacted row: cell color highlight is just like a non-impacted table cell
- After the right-most cell of that row with error messaging, TAB moves the cell focus to the next table cell in the row below (as usual with table keyboard navigation)
- The div message goes away and then appears for the next table row if there are errors or warnings for that row

- Recent table cell content edits are not validated until the user presses SAVE button for validation (TBD: except for some cells that do tab-out validation?? need to verify with Siva)

- Recent table cell content edits do not impact the inline messages (in other words, the messages are not dynamic or "live", responding to user's changes to table data in real-time)

- If user double-clicks another table cell elsewhere in an un-impacted row, then the edit frame for that cell appears as usual, AND all error/warning divs are hidden (but the error/warning icons in the row handle for the impacted rows are still visible and clickable to expose their div messages)



** Scrolling:

Vertical scrolling: the floating div message does disappear off the screen as user scrolls down the table and then re-appears on screen as user scrolls back up the table


Horizontal scrolling: the div message stays fixed in place as the user scrolls laterally to reveal the other table columns 


Resizing: as user resizes the window outward, the div message content and controls remain in place while the background fills out the expanding window as it resizes outward. as the user resizes the window inward, the div message content and controls remain in place and gets clipped as the window moves inward.


- The div message is FIXED and non-resizable, and does not grow with the content inside!


** Navigating among messages:

- Numeric Dots in message area show the number of messages for the selected row and which one of those the user is currently viewing
- Dots ARE clickable
- If only one error or warning for a row, then don't show any dots
- If only one error or warning for a row, back/next arrows still appear to allow navigation to the next row, next to each other since no dots shown
- If there's only one error or warning in the whole table, then don't show any dots and don't show navigation controls

- If user has addressed one of the messages for a row (in a series of messages for that row), then the visual appearance of the number changes (see PSD and prototype) with the addressed icon (see above)
- That number is still clickable and retains the highlighting style of selected numbers


- Left/Right arrows are "Back" and "Next", showing the appropriate messages upon SINGLE CLICK 
- Arrows shift their position as number of messages (dots) changes for a row accordingly
- No technical limit to the number of messages (dots), although realistically most have 1 to 3 messages

- On the very first message of the very first impacted row, Back button is shown to allow for circular navigation (user convenience)
- On the very last message of the very last impacted row, Next button is shown to allow for circular navigation (user convenience)
- If user gets to the last message of the last impacted row, but had skipped other messages intentionally and not addressed them (by choosing an option to accept or ignore, etc.), then Next button still appears, and cycles the user to through the messages that were skipped until all have been addressed

** REMEMBER: error/warning corrections and acceptances do not take affect UNTIL user clicks SAVE!!!

- IF feasible, the corresponding impacted table cell is highlighted for each message as the user navigates back/next through the dot navigator (TBD/proto)
- After reaching the last message for the selected table row, pressing NEXT moves the focus and selection to the next row that has error/warning messaging and reveals the first error/warning message for that row (TBD/proto the motion--ideally a sliding motion to reveal and focus the proper message within the table)


** Specific warning situations (ongoing itemization, determining general patterns along the way):

1. Item "xxx" must be associated with sites [1, 2, 3] in order to be included on this BOM.
( ) Do not add this item
( ) Add item with site association
( ) Add item without site association

BUTTON :Apply to similar warnings (this choice is found at the bottom)

Behavior:
- Radio button choices
- Upon clicking button to apply to similar warnings, all other related warnings are no longer highlighted in the table (unless those rows have other un-related errors/warnings)
- Those similar related rows then have the addressed icon in row handle
- Clicking Next skips those similar warnings


2. There is a mismatch between the reference designator for Item [xxx] and its quantity. Please correct in the table. 
[ ] Ignore warning

BUTTON: Ignore similar warnings

Behavior: 
- User can directly edit the cells in the impacted row; doing so does NOT cause message to go away or get corrected however! user must still click SAVE to officially enforce all changes.
- Checking "Ignore warning" causes row to de-highlight if it's the only one on the row and warning icon in handle is replaced with neutral dot indicator
- Clicking "Ignore similar warnings" causes this row AND all related rows in the table (presuming they do not have multiple errors/warnings per row) to de-highlight and replace the row handle icon with the addressed icon 
- Clicking Next skips those similar warnings


3. The Find Number [xxx] is already used for Item [yyy]. Please correct.
[ ] Ignore warning

BUTTON: Ignore similar warnings

Behavior: 
- User can directly edit the cells in the impacted row; doing so does NOT cause message to go away or get corrected however! user must still click SAVE to officially enforce all changes.
- Checking "Ignore warning" causes row to de-highlight if it's the only one on the row and warning icon in handle is replaced with neutral dot indicator
- Clicking "Ignore similar warnings" causes this row AND all related rows in the table (presuming they do not have multiple errors/warnings per row) to de-highlight and replace the row handle icon with the addressed icon
- Clicking Next skips those similar warnings


4. This item contains other Items and/or Manufacturer Parts
( ) Remove spec from this Item
( ) Remove spec from all Items
BUTTON: Apply to similar warnings

Behavior:
- Radio button choices
- Upon clicking button to apply to similar warnings, all other related warnings are no longer highlighted in the table (unless those rows have other un-related errors/warnings)
- Those similar related rows then have the addressed icon in row handle
- Clicking Next skips those similar warnings


5. This item is currently on pending changes [x,y,z]
( ) Do not add item
( ) Add Item anyway
BUTTON: Apply to similar warnings

Behavior:
- Radio button choices
- Upon clicking checkbox to apply to similar warnings, all other related warnings are no longer highlighted in the table (unless those rows have other un-related errors/warnings)
- Those similar related rows then have the addressed icon in row handle
- Clicking Next skips those similar warnings


6. There are attachments on the latest revision of this Affected Item
( ) Copy Attachments
( ) Do not copy attachments
BUTTON: Apply to similar warnings

Behavior:
- Radio button choices
- Upon clicking checkbox to apply to similar warnings, all other related warnings are no longer highlighted in the table (unless those rows have other un-related errors/warnings)
- Those similar related rows then have the addressed icon in row handle
- Clicking Next skips those similar warnings


** Other important points:

- Click X to hide the div message but it does NOT dismiss or accept the errors/warnings; row is then de-highlighted, focus is reset (not on any row)
- To see the inline message, user clicks EITHER the row handle error/warning icon (or the neutral dot indicator which indicates the message has been dealt with somehow), or a cell within the impacted row
- Single-clicking the cell shows the blue cell highlight color as usual
- Double-clicking a cell within the impacted row shows the edit frame for that cell of the row AND the inline message for that impact row/cell
- User cannot bring up two inline messages for different impact rows; only ONE inline message can be shown at a time
- So if the user double-clicks a cell of a different row, then:
1) if the different row is an impacted error/warning row, put focus on that row, show the edit frame for that cell user just double-clicked, show the inline message for that row, and hide the inline message for the previous row
2) if the different row is not an impacted row (ie, is a normal row), put focus on that row, show the edit frame for that cell just double-clicked, and hide the inline message for the previous row
- If a cell in the impacted row has no-privilege data cells, then TBD
- If a cell in the impacted row has non-editable data cells, then TBD
- The dot navigator IS clickable, showing the appropriate message upon click of a dot
- No keyboarding to navigate among the div messages (it is its own closed-loop UI, can't tab in/out of it); user has to click on the error or warning icon in the row handle of the rows to show their div messages (TBD, considering options...)
