Personalizing the Table
updated by Uday Gajendar
on 12/17/2007


CORE ABILITIES
===========================
1. Single Column Sorting: dynamically in the table itself

2. Multi-Column Sorting: via palette

3. Column Resizing: dynamically in the table itself

4. Column Reordering: via palette

5. Column Hide/Show: via palette

6. Column Freeze/Unfreeze: via palette

7. Column Filtering: via palette


CANNOT
- cannot freeze a hidden column
- cannot sort a hidden column
- cannot resize a hidden column


CAN
- can re-order a sorted column
- can re-size a sorted column
- can freeze a sorted column
- can freeze a resized column
- can freeze a re-ordered column
- can re-order a frozen column
- can re-order a hidden column
- can sort a frozen column
- can resize a frozen column
- can hide a frozen column, but set the freeze to none. This way we can handle the situation where an admin disables the column with the same approach.


ALSO...
- if it's not in the table, can't define a filter/view/sort on it
- if admin hides it then it would no longer be displayed in the table, or in the view configuration palette.
- If frozen, will reset to have no column frozen
- If sort, won't be included in sort, or displayed in sort definition
- If displayed (not hidden), will no longer be displayed in the table
or palettes.


PERSISTENCE (WIP)
===========================
- We will persist personalization within a session
- But if the user personalizes the table and then attempts to switch the table view, they should be prompted to save their personalization or lose it.  So, users have to save a view to be able to flip between them...
- And if user logs out, then don't persist the personalization
- But should prompt user about possible lost personalization options



IN TABLE INTERACTIONS
===========================

1. Single Column Sorting:

- Only certain columns are sortable
- Hover state upon column header indicates if that column is sortable
- Hover state visual: background color change (#A8C7FF)

- CLICK a column header to sort 

- Sort is per toggling:
-- Click once: sort up (ascending)
-- Click again: sort down (descending)
-- Click a different column: previous column is cleared of its sort and new column is sorted ascending

- Visual feedback of sort direction shown by up arrow (ascending) or down arrow (descending) icons in column header with column header color emphasis (see PSD)
- Sort icons persist until new sort or sort cleared or different column sorted
- Upon resizing the column inward, the sort indicator truncates column header text (see table_viewing_content.txt for header truncation rules)
- Tooltip upon hover of sort icon:
-- "Sort ascending" for up arrow icon
-- "Sort descending" for down arrow icon

Does column single sorting impact table view definition? yes, confirmed by Joel via email (10/10)


2. Column Resizing:

- DRAG column header edge to resize a column accordingly
- This is a "live drag", with visual feedback shown as user drags column edge (column resizes in real-time)
- CURSOR: column resizer icon on hover of column header edge (per browser default)

* Limits: 
- No maximum width (drag out) 
- 5 character minimum width to allow user to double-click to bring up the edit frame
- User can resize any number of columns 
- CANNOT resize a frozen column

- Column cannot be any smaller than 5 characters width; tooltip shows full column header and/or cell data values (per OS/browser tooltip size/timing/duration defaults)

- DRAG pushes out the rest of the columns, forcing horizontal scroll of table accordingly

Does column resizing impact table view definition? yes, confirmed by Joel via email (10/10)



IN-PALETTE INTERACTIONS
===========================

Multi-column sorting, filtering, hiding/showing, and freezing/unfreezing columns are handled in the personalization palette, a tabbed moveable component that floats above the table.

This palette is resizable and moveable, whose position and sizing are remembered for a session per defined palette interaction rules (for ex: MSL search/filter palette, MSCL search/filter palette, etc.)

Upon first launch the palette appears centered above the table. (x/y coordinates?)

Warnings/Errors:
- Errors are indicated by:
-- DMS error message 
-- Error icon at the field level (as done for form layouts)
-- Error tip text at the field level (as done for form layouts)

The following are considered errors:
- badly formatted date
- invalid data type (for ex: entering text for numeric field)

Leaving a field blank within the filter tab (for ex: not inputting a date at all when he selected a calendar attribute) is not considered to be an error and thus nothing should be shown to the user when he clicks APPLY.


Palette global actions:

1. Close X: Click the close "x" to dismiss the palette; same as ESC, no impact upon the table, all changes lost

2. Apply: Click to apply settings/values from ALL tabs onto the table (table reloads, with ajax loader cue as appropriate)

3. Close: Click to not apply any changes made in any of the tab settings, and dismiss the palette entirely, all changes lost



Palette trigger:
The personalization palette is triggered from selecting the appropriate command from the More Actions table menu, with that specific tab selected in the foreground:
1. Sort columns: for sorting across multiple columns (up to 3)
2. Filter table: for setting various filters upon table contents (no limit? TBD)
3. Format columns: for hiding, freezing, and re-ordering columns


1. Format columns tab: 

This combines the ability to show/hide columns and freeze/unfreeze columns into one unified control, a palette that appears above the table, triggered from the More Actions menu by the "Format Columns" action. 

See below for the breakdown of selection ability for showing and freezing columns.


REORDER COLUMNS:

The user can dynamically re-order columns by dragging and dropping the column names up and down the table. Topmost row is equal to the leftmost column in a table. See PSD for the visual drag highlighting of the place where you want to drag a table row.

- User can re-order any number of columns
- CANNOT re-order frozen (locked) columns (all columns in a frozen group)
- Frozen columns are denoted by the selected radio button

To DRAG and DROP the column header:
- Must click and drag the row handle
- Cursor is an arrow with a ghosted image of the column name
- The acceptable drop target highlights when hovered over (see PSD)
- If user drags column header onto an invalid area, then show the "do not" cursor
- If DRAG target is scrolled off-screen, then table scrolls in the direction of the drag, as long as user is moused-down "holding" the column header to be moved

* Special situation: If there are cases where certain columns are "paired" together whereby splitting them is not allowed, then dragging one column automatically drags the other column too (TBD, need discussion of cases)

* Special situation: If there is a parent/child column situation, user can only drag the parent column, and the child cols come with the parent to new location (TBD, per coqsoft ability)



HIDE/SHOW COLUMNS:

- Should have at least 1 column showing 
- CANNOT hide all columns in a table
- Allowed to hide frozen columns
- Select/unselect checkboxes accordingly with checkboxes (check = show this column)

- Check the checkbox for "All Columns" to show all columns
- When this is checked, then all other checkboxes in the column become checked as well
- If "All Columns" becomes unchecked, then the other checkboxes are unchecked altogether as well
- If after checking "All Colunns" the the user unchecks a few of the individual columns, then the checkbox for "All Columns" becomes a mixed state, defaulted by browser/OS

- CLICK APPLY to commit choice and update table view
- CLICK CLOSE to discard choices; no warning or prompt shown. Table remains unchanged, no refresh or anything


FREEZE COLUMNS:

- All columns to the left of the chosen column are automatically frozen to prevent awkward horizontal scrolling scenarios
- CANNOT re-order frozen columns
- CANNOT re-size frozen columns
- CAN edit frozen columns

- Select/unselect accordingly with radio buttons (select = freeze this column) 
- Can only freeze contiguous columns to prevent awkward horizontal scrolling scenarios
- Cannot freeze the next to last column
- Can only freeze columns that are visible in the table

- Frozen column is visually distinguished in the impacted table with lock icon in column header and thick vertical rule on right (see PSD)
- Frozen cells are still editable, keyboard interactive with TAB, ENTER, ARROW, and mouse clicks


UNFREEZE COLUMNS:

- select "No Columns" option
- CLICK APPLY to commit choice and update table
- CLICK CLOSE to discard choices; no warning or prompt shown. Table remains unchanged, no refresh or anything



2. Multi-column sorting

- Limit of up to three different columns can be sorted at once
- In the palette all three sort combinations are shown at once. User is free to use all 3 or just 2 or even just 1 (which would be weird, but allowable)
- User clicks Apply to set the sorting combinations for the table. Table reloads with new sort orders. An FYI DMS appears saying "Multiple sort criteria have been successfully applied." (or similar verbiage). 
- See PSD for multi-column sorting visual indicator (column header is highlighted with numeric and up/down arrow indicators)

- CLICK APPLY to commit choice and update table
- CLICK CLOSE to discard choices; no warning or prompt shown. Table remains unchanged, no refresh or anything



3. Filter rows

** Upon initial launch of filter tab: (per view definition)
- The matching criteria message is not shown (which asks for "any" or "all")
- The filter criteria only has one row of criteria 
- The first row is defaulted with the first attribute in the attribute menu already selected, same for the operator menu
- The Remove button for the first row is disabled
- The Remove button for the first row becomes enabled after another row of criteria has been added

(NOTE: if the view definition has filters assigned, then on first launch of the filter tab, show the appropriate fields and values)

- Matching criteria: The "Show data that matches..." appears ONLY after 2 or more criteria are visible (when user has added an additional row). Default droplist selection is All. Other choice is Any. 

-- Attributes menu: list of all the attributes from the table to be filtered on. Selecting an attribute will dynamically update the Value control (droplist, datepicker, MSL, etc.) to the appropriate UI control for value selection or data entry.
- For all the different types of controls that are possible, follow the spacing example in the PSD (10px vertical spacing)

-- Operator menu: list of all the possible operations the user can perform in the Agile system to filter the table (equal, not equal, less than, etc.)

(TBD: Need a comprehensive listing of all possible operators documented)

- CLICK Add button to add another criteria row
-- Row pops in, no wait or reloading
- CLICK Remove button to remove the criteria row
-- Row disappears, no wait or reloading
- CLICK Apply to apply the filter criteria to the table; table reloads with filters applied accordingly
- CLICK Close to cancel filter criteria and close the palette

- It is OK to have MSL, and other UI controls with their own palettes, to trigger their palette as usual just like in table or form layouts 
- Calendar appears BELOW the date picker icon, just like in the form and table situations; no edge detection with palette edge. It's OK for the calendar to overlap the palette edge
- MSL, SSL, MSCL palettes appear above to the right of the search icon triggering the palette; no edge detection with palette edge. It's OK for the search palettes to overlap the palette edge

As user adds more rows of criteria, scrollbar appears and scrolls down vertically as needed with every new row added (new rows are added at the bottom).


- CLICK APPLY to commit choice and update table
- CLICK CLOSE to discard choices; no warning or prompt shown. Table remains unchanged, no refresh or anything
