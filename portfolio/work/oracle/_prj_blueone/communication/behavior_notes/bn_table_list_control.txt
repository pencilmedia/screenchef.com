mockup file/location: table_actions.psd


UI COMPONENT DEFINITION:
List is a menu of data values for a user to choose. It is not editable by the user in the UI. User can only choose among the values in that list. Can be found in any table as needed. 

Limits:
No technical limits, but keep in mind:
- possible performance hit with having too many items in the list
- usability issues with having more than 20 - 25 items in the list

Dependencies: 

Default width:



TERMINOLOGY:

Divot: the downward pointing arrow that the user clicks on to reveal the full menu list

Focus: The normal browser notion of focus. Will allow events to fire relative to the object that has the focus.

Selection: Add the element that received an event to a collection of objects for code to operate on.

Visual Selection: A visual cue to the user that demonstrates the selected state of an object.




UI LAYOUT:

In read view:
- the text is justified left within table cell
- data is truncated per browser abilities
- data revealed/hidden per table column resizing (see table_behavior_notes.txt)

In edit view:
- for long string values within the menu: the list itself is clipped
- width of the list of values is dependent upon OS behavior
- the list control sits within a visually selected table cell, which is a div on top of that cell
- the list control is centered within that div

Positioning:
If on the far Right column:
- UOM, datepicker, MSL, and multitext all move in leftward so nothing is jutting outside of the table frame

If on the bottom row:
- multitext read and edit div goes upward from the cell
- MSL read div goes upward from the cell
- datepicker calendar appears above the cell when the button is pressed
- MSL edit div and single-select search goes upward


VISUAL DISPLAY:

ICONOGRAPHY: 

- only the menu divot which comes free with the list control across all supported browsers and platforms

>> BEHAVIORS
************************************************
------------------------------
IN GENERAL...
------------------------------

MOUSE ACTIONS:

- CLICK on a cell: cell is highlighted
- DOUBLE-CLICK on a cell: UI control appears
- CLICK menu divot: list menu appears showing the entire list of data values (including any disabled values, if that is applicable)
- for long string values within the menu: the list itself is clipped per OS/browser 
- width of the list of values is dependent upon OS behavior
- HOVER the list items: browser/platform-based highlighting appears for each list item the user hovers
- If item has a tooltip (for ex: UOM units list control), then show the tooltip per OS/browser 



KEYBOARD COMMANDS:

- TAB: puts focus on cell, and shows the read view (equal to CLICK above)
- ENTER: UI control appears  (equal to DOUBLE-CLICK above)
- ARROW UP/DOWN: cycles through the list choices one by one (menu is not shown)
- ENTER again: confirms list item selection, UI control disappears
- ESC: discards changes, UI controls disappear, prior data is shown in table cell; table cell has focus and visually selected




TAB INDEX ORDER:

- across cells: horizontally, left to right, then down to the next row




DEFAULT STATES:

- default width: depends upon the width of the table column; data values truncated accordingly
- for long values: the list itself is clipped
