Editing Table Content
updated by Uday Gajendar

BASIC
========================
- Save and cancel buttons are enabled the moment an edit is made to any table data cell
- When the first edit is happening, FYI message does "pop and fade" in DMS telling the user to remember to click save to commit edits (message TBD, placeholder in PSD file)
- Default state: Save and cancel buttons are visible but disabled (see button spec)
- Default state: Undo and redo are disabled in More Actions (see menu spec)
- Default state: Fill up and fill down are disabled in More Actions (see menu spec)
- Double-clicking headers does nothing
- For carriage returns in multi-text field: ALT + ENTER


NON-EDITABLE CELLS

- Non-editable cells are indistinguishable from editable cells by default. But non-editable cells have a dot pattern (see PSD) upon SINGLE CLICK. Upon DOUBLE-CLICK, FYI message does "pop and fade" in DMS telling user the cell is not editable. (no javascript alert!)
- Pressing TAB skips the non-editable cells
- Upon row selection the non-editable cells appear blue like other cells (no dot pattern)
- Focus is not visible to user, but behind the scenes the focus is on the non-editable cell, SO if user presses TAB then the focus goes to the next editable cell


NO PRIVILEGE CELLS

- No privilege cells show the hash mark icon. If user SINGLE CLICK, then the dot pattern appears. Upon DOUBLE-CLICK, FYI message does "pop and fade" in DMS telling user no privilege to view the data. (no javascript alert!)
- Pressing TAB skips the no-priv cells
- Upon row selection the no-priv cells appear blue like other cells (hash mark icon against blue background)
- Focus is not visible to user, but behind the scenes the focus is on the no-priv cell, SO if user presses TAB then the focus goes to the next editable cell




- For auto-completion (for MSL and SSL): 
-- for single value fields: Type value in field, auto-completion list of values appears, user arrows down, press ENTER, field becomes read state, with data value set, focus and visual cue on current table cell
-- for multiple value fields: Type value in field, auto-complete list of values appears, user arrows down, press ENTER, that value is added to the pillbox area, focus on current cell, edit controls still visible and in-focus for repeat use... user has to press ENTER again to flip to read state, setting just-added values...press TAB to move to next table cell laterally



* Save:
- CLICK: commits data to back-end
- IF save is good: show FYI message in DMS telling user edits successfully saved
- Table reloads accordingly
- IF save is bad: show FYI message in DMS telling user edits were not saved and to try again or contact sys admin (** unless errors were found and can be itemized, then show table error messaging -- TBD)


Note: If user clicks save while editing a table cell (in the edit frame), then the table reloads with the edit frame gone and user was mid-keystroke entering data, lose orientation/get lost, have to hunt for the cell he was editing, which may be in new place due to sorting done after the save. And additional danger of incomplete data value entered, causing validation errors. That's just what happens, not preferred UX but at user's risk to click Save while editing table data.



* Cancel:
- CLICK: triggers javascript pop-up alert asking user to confirm if he really wants to cancel and lose all edits/changes. Alert should have (if feasible), a checkbox option "do not show me again". If alert is confirmed with OK, then all edits are discarded and table reloads, reverts to last saved values. If user clicks CANCEL, then the pop-up alert disappears and nothing is lost in the table. 
- If user clicked Cancel button and then cancelled the pop-up alert while editing an edit frame in the table, then that edit frame remains persistent visually so user can easily get back to it.
- Clicking Cancel does not force edit frames and/or palettes to suddenly disappear


ADVANCED
========================

UNDO

Found in the More Actions menu
Keyboard command: TBD (CTRL + Z)

- Undo applicable to the following data actions:
-- edits of existing table cell data
-- entry of new table cell data
-- removing a table row of data
-- pasting in a row of data
-- adding a row of data (new object creation) *
-- fill up/down of data for table cells

* These cases may involve the creation of objects in the database which must be handled specially (verify with Siva). Consider a pop-up javascript that asks user to delete the object from back-end and front-end? (TBD...complexity of this case to be monitored by Phanee/Siva accordingly)

- Undo limits: number is TBD (per Siva, need to verify)
- A new undo cycle begins with each Save, even if you get errors/warnings still in edit mode
- Cannot undo the following: Save, Cancel, Filter, Sort
- User is able to undo table bulk action (for example, the fill up/down) which is considered as one action, not multiple actions
- If user accidentally hits ESC while in an edit frame, it just reverts back to prior data as stated in table behavior notes. User cannot Undo an ESC.
- Can undo edit frame changes after ENTER or TAB:
-- focus goes back to (or retained on) the cell to be undone with visual selection cue and browser focus (just like Excel)
- In an edit frame, undo is done for specific keystroke inputs, such as changing a numeric value from 1 > 2 > 3, undo takes user back to 2, then undo again back to 1



REDO

Found in the More Actions menu
Keyboard command: TBD (CTRL + Y)

- Redo applicable to the following data actions:
-- edits of existing table cell data
-- entry of new table cell data
-- removing a table row of data
-- pasting in a row of data 
-- adding a row of data (new object creation) *
-- fill up/down of data for table cells

* Need to check with Siva for these, since special impact on database. (TBD...complexity of this case to be monitored by Phanee/Siva accordingly)

- Limit of redo: number based upon number of undo's done
- No redo possible until an action is undone first
- Cannot redo the following: Save, Cancel, Filter, Sort
- Focus and visual selection cue goes to the cell impacted by a redo

- Undo/redo should be expected in forms as well (TBD)



FILL UP and FILL DOWN 
(for the same column only, not multiple column)

Found in the More Actions menu
Keyboard command: TBD (CTRL + SHIFT + F)

- SHIFT + CLICK (for contiguous selection) or CTRL + CLICK (for non-contiguous/toggle select) the cells to be impacted, including the source cell and the destination cell(s)

- IF unsuccessful, then show FYI message in DMS as needed

- How to handle the table scrolling? (where the source and destination cells are in different paginated scrolls/blocks in the table): Improve performance if possible. User has to simply deal with it. We can lessen the pain with appropriate ajax loaders/spinners and cell highlighting accordingly (kinda like Yahoo mail beta).

- Handling rows of different object types: Simply don't fill those cells of different object type AND show DMS message informing user that certain rows were not filled due to different object type

- If user targets a field that cannot be filled, then:
-- disable the fill up/down action in the More Actions menu
-- show DMS if keyboard action used
