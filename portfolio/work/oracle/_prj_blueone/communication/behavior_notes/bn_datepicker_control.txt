prototype available? partial

mockup available? Y

mockup file/location: table_actions.psd




UI COMPONENT DEFINITION:
Date picker is a control that allows selection of a date and/or time as needed, for a table cell. Various keyboard shortcuts allow expedient date entry as defined in the date picker spec. Can be found in any table as needed.

Limits:
Date format is set per user preferences

Dependencies:
User prefs and system prefs for formatting, long/short date, etc.

Default width:
as its done currently for the form



TERMINOLOGY:

Calendar Pop-up: the actual visual calendar that comes up upon clicking the launch button

Launch Button: the date picker icon/button

Month Selector: the region for choosing the month by clicking the associated icons (back, next, etc.)

Previous Month: for navigating back one month

Next Month: for navigating forward one month

Previous Year: for navigating back one year from current date

Next Year: for navigating forward one year from current date

Date Selection: the visual cue for the currently selected date

Time Section: the selectors for setting the time (hour, minute, AM/PM)

Focus: The normal browser notion of focus. Will allow events to fire relative to the object that has the focus.

Selection: Add the element that received an event to a collection of objects for code to operate on.

Visual Selection: A visual cue to the user that demonstrates the selected state of an object.




UI LAYOUT:

In read view:
- text is justified left within table cell
- data is truncated per browser abilities
- data revealed/hidden per table column resizing 
(see table_behavior_notes.txt)

In edit view:
- calendar pop-up appears below the datepicker icon, based upon edge-detection against the browser window (see: implementation and tiffany's prototype)

- If any time controls, they are located at the bottom of the calendar pop-up


Positioning:
If on the far Right column:
- UOM, datepicker, MSL, and multitext all move in leftward so nothing is jutting outside of the table frame

If on the bottom row:
- multitext read and edit div goes upward from the cell
- MSL read div goes upward from the cell
- datepicker calendar appears above the cell when the button is pressed
- MSL edit div and single-select search goes upward


VISUAL DISPLAY:
table_actions.psd




ICONOGRAPHY: 

- datepicker icon for the button: 16 x 16 pixels
- back arrow, double back arrow, next arrow, and double next arrow: 16 x 16 pixels




************************************************
>> BEHAVIORS
************************************************
------------------------------
GENERAL (follow Vern's       published spec)
------------------------------
The behavior of the Date Entry Field conforms to the generic specification of UI Controls in Forms found in the Forms specification.
¥ The Date Only version of this field will display the same date to every user around the globe.
¥ The Date and Time version of this field will display the date and time in the userÕs preferred time zone. When a user changes the value, it will be set based on this time zone. When a user in a different time zone views the value, it will show a different time and may show a different date.




MOUSE ACTIONS: 

- CLICK on a cell: cell is highlighted
- DOUBLE-CLICK on a cell: UI control appears
- If any data values already entered, data is highlighted upon DOUBLE-CLICK
- Data highlight color is defaulted per OS/browser
- Cursor is at the end of the text




KEYBOARD COMMANDS: 

- TAB: move browser focus laterally across table cells to next editable field or down to the first editable field in the next row; commits data if any entered before pressing TAB
- RETURN or ENTER: toggle "edit" and "view " states for a cell; if pressed after data entry, then data is committed, focus kept on current cell
- ESC: discards changes, UI controls disappear, prior data is shown in table cell; table cell has focus and visually selected
- TAB preserves edits 

- Use browser-defined behaviors for text input area (ARROW, HOME, PAGE DOWN, PAGE UP, END, etc.)

- TAB to calendar button
- ENTER to launch the calendar
- ARROW to the date
- ENTER to close the calendar, set the date in the edit frame, focus remains on the calendar button
- TAB to set the value in this cell and move focus to next cell

for mouse interactions:
- CLICK the calendar button
- DOUBLE-CLICK a date in the calendar closes the calendar, sets the date in the edit frame, focus remains on the calendar button

To move to next table cell: TAB twice or ENTER to return to view mode, then TAB to next cell



TAB INDEX ORDER:

- across cells: horizontally, left to right, then down to the next row
- within calendar pop-up: >> follow Vern's       published spec



DEFAULT STATES:

- Upon entering edit state, any contents are visually selected and in focus, ready for editing via keyboard
