BASIC
========================
* CLICK on a cell: cell is highlighted visually
* DOUBLE-CLICK on a cell: cell becomes editable, edit frame appears
* If cell is a text field, then text is highlighted upon DOUBLE-CLICK
* Text highlight color is defaulted per OS/browser
* CLICK row handle to select whole row of data (see PSD)
* CLICK off the edit frame: UI controls dismissed; any entered data IS set for the field
* ESC: dismiss UI controls and revert data values (if any entered); focus/visual selection on current cell
* TAB: move focus laterally across table cells to next editable field or down to the first editable field in the next row; commits data if any entered
- cell is highlighted visually (see PSD)
* TAB order: horizontally, left to right, then down to the next row
* ARROW UP/DOWN/RIGHT/LEFT: move focus to next field or down to the first field in the next row table cells (see PSD)
* RETURN or ENTER: toggle "edit" and "view " states for a cell; if pressed after data entry, then data is set, focus kept on current cell (see PSD)

- row handle unselected: D8D8D8
- row handle selected: 999999
- column header unselected: F2F2F2
- column header selected: TBD
- row unselected: FFFFFF
- row selected: DBEAFF
- cell unselected: same as row
- cell selected: A8C7FF

- error/warning row (selected): 5F0303

- Enabled Save button is blue (see PSD)


Icons:
- no privilege
- gray dot 
- error icon (in row handle)
- warning icon (in row handle)
- neutral change indicator (in row handle)


Read-only cells: 
- CLICK: dotted pattern appears
- CLICK + DRAG: select/highlight the data value for copy/paste
- DOUBLE-CLICK: causes an FYI/prompt in the message area to "pop and fade" in telling user that the cell is not editable + dotted pattern appears

(** NOTE: the user is still able to ARROW to the read-only cells, resulting in standard cell focus, not a dot pattern but TAB skips the read-only cells)


Other viewing content:
- Header truncation: Yes truncate, as user resizes the column size inward, place ellipses where possible per browser abilities
- Dual header truncation: yes truncate, the subheaders move in/out proportionally as the column width is increased/decreased
- Headers have tooltips

- Cell data truncation: yes truncate, as user resizes the column size inward, place ellipses where possible per browser abilities
- Where possible (per browser ability), have a tooltip that shows full data value
- No tooltip for MSL or Multi-line text controls 
- Debating whether to show the appropriate read-only div on mouse over (TBD)

- Non-editable cells are indistinguishable from editable cells by default. But non-editable cells have a dot pattern (see PSD) upon CLICK. Upon DOUBLE-CLICK, FYI message does "pop and fade" in DMS telling user the cell is not editable. (no javascript alert!)
- No privilege cells show the hash mark icon. If user clicks it once, nothing happens. Upon DOUBLE-CLICK, FYI message does "pop and fade" in DMS telling user no privilege to view the data. (no javascript alert!)
- Double-clicking headers does nothing
- In read mode, headers and table cell data can be selected for copy/paste using the text cursor (mouse drag across cells) or via keyboarding
- For  multi-line text, the text value will be truncated per cell width
- Same for multi-select list values or multi-select cascade list values, separated by semicolon, but that list is truncated per cell width

- Links are displayed in the defined link style per current Agile CSS (blue text with underline on hover)


Scrolling:
- As user scrolls the table up/down, an ajax-style spinner appears until table data content has been loaded in place
- User can scroll directly to the very top or very bottom of scrollbar
- Need to maximize performance to minimize user frustration of waiting for content to load


Table dead-space:
- If table does not have further data rows to scroll, then show dead-space below the table (see concept car)


ADVANCED
========================
Full table display TBD
