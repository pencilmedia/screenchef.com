UI COMPONENT DEFINITION:
Text field is an alphanumeric text input field within a table cell. It can accept alphanumeric characters per specific field constraints. It is NOT multiple lines, only a single horizontal line. Can be found in any table as needed.

Limits:
Display width is set in admin, irrespective of character max

Dependencies: 
Input frame width increase/decrease as user resizes the column (see table_behavior_notes.txt)

Default width:




TERMINOLOGY:

Input frame: the actual physical structure for inputting text

Focus: The normal browser notion of focus. Will allow events to fire relative to the object that has the focus.

Selection: Add the element that received an event to a collection of objects for code to operate on.

Visual Selection: A visual cue to the user that demonstrates the selected state of an object.




UI LAYOUT:

* In read view:
- the text is justified left within table cell
- data is truncated per browser abilities
- data revealed/hidden per table column resizing (see table_behavior_notes.txt)

* In edit state:
- the input frame sits within a visually selected table cell
- the input frame is justified left within that cell


Positioning:
If on the far Right column:
- UOM, datepicker, MSL, and multitext all move in leftward so nothing is jutting outside of the table frame

If on the bottom row:
- multitext read and edit div goes upward from the cell
- MSL read div goes upward from the cell
- datepicker calendar appears above the cell when the button is pressed
- MSL edit div and single-select search goes upward


VISUAL DISPLAY:

* In read state:
11pt Arial, 15pt leading
#333 color

* In edit state:
11pt Arial, 15pt leading
#333 color

>> BEHAVIORS
************************************************
------------------------------
IN GENERAL...
------------------------------

MOUSE ACTIONS:

- CLICK on a cell: cell is highlighted
- DOUBLE-CLICK on a cell: UI control appears
- If any text already entered, text is highlighted upon DOUBLE-CLICK
- Text highlight color is defaulted per OS/browser
- Cursor is at the end of the text




KEYBOARD COMMANDS:

- TAB: puts focus on cell, visually selected
- ENTER: UI control appears  (same as DOUBLE-CLICK above)
- ENTER again: confirms search selection, UI controls disappear, focus on current cell
- ESC: discards changes, and shows the cell with prior data, focus on current cell
- ARROW UP/DOWN: puts focus on above/below cell

- Use browser-defined behaviors for text input area (ARROW, HOME, PAGE DOWN, PAGE UP, END, etc.)



TAB INDEX ORDER:

- across cells: horizontally, left to right, then down to the next row, skips non-editable cells



DEFAULT STATES:

- Upon entering edit mode, any text contents are visually selected and in focus, ready for editing via keyboard
- Cursor is placed at the end of text block
- SCROLL leftward as user types in text field, per character limits
- If text extends beyond cell width, then upon DOUBLE-CLICK show the end part of the text, where the cursor is
