		<h3>What is the context of their work?</h3>

    	of what they are doing that tell us what they are trying to do and what they need.
    	Observing user's tasks, the tools they use and their ecosystem helps us define the problem
    	and solutions they need.  Use our toolkit to define user's needs and wants.</p>
