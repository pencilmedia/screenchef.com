						<h3>User Profiles and Roles</h3>
						<p>Your user profile describes the key characteristics and goals of the people using your application. User profiles also are important in designing a company’s customization of an application. Often, customizations are needed because a company’s work practices are unique. The designer of the customization not only needs to know those practices but how the software implements the practices and, especially, how it constrains them. With a user profile, the designer can fit the design to the user’s attributes. For example, if a task sequence will be new to relatively novice computer users, the design may use a wizard or constrained sequence of steps to guide them.</p>
						<p>The user profile also keeps a team of designers on the same page about users, so that different designers are making the same assumptions about the user attributes.</p>
