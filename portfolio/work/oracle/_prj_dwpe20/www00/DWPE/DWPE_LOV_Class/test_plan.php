		<ol>
		<li>Test Dialog Output & Runtime
			
			<ul>
				<li>Create a new test page.</li>
				<li>From the DWPE2 Insert Bar, click the form icon <img src="../DWPE_Extension/images/dwpe-icon-form.png" valign="middle"> and select the "LOV" menu item.  The LOV dialog should appear.</li>
				<li>On the attributes tab enter values for state,required,default_value and help. Search Dialog URL is reserved for future use.</li>
				<li>Click OK to commit your changes.</li>
				<li>In design mode a component placeholder will appear at the insertion point. </li>
				<li>Preview the page in Firefox.  Does the control render correctly? Does the control behave correctly?</li>
				<li>Note that clicking the LOV icon does not function.</li>
			
			</ul>
		</li>
		
		<li>Test Dialog Reentry:
			<ul>
				<li>In Dreamweaver design mode, find the component you just created.</li>
				<li>Click the component name.  The Property Inspector below the design pane will refresh. It will show the component name and provide an edit button. Click
				the edit button. The dialog will display the settings as they were the last time the dialog was visited for this component. </li>
				<li>Make a change to the settings, click OK and verify the change is saved onto the page properly. Verify it displays in Firefox correctly.</li>
				<li>In design mode, click the component name again. Press CTRL+C to copy the component. Place your cursor somewhere else on the page and press CTRL+V to paste it there. </li> 
				<li>Click the new component name and verify that dialog reentry works correctly on this copy.</li>
				<li>Note that the code mode still allows you to do in-place edits of the HTML. However, in-place edits are not recognized by dialog reentry.</li>
				<li>Note that components created with builds prior to this week will not support dialog reentry.</li>
			</ul>
		</li> 
		
		<li>Test Templates:
			<ul>
				<li>In Dreamweaver design mode, find the component you created in previous steps. Use the property inspector to reenter the dialog.  </li>
				<li>Choose Save as Template and give it a name. Cancel out of the dialog.</li>
				<li>Find a new place on your page to insert the component.  Use the insert bar to launch the component dialog. </li> 
				<li>Open the templates tab. Highlight the template name you saved before and press the load button. Are the settings restored from the template as you expect?</li>
				<li>Press OK. Does the dialog insert the component correctly on the page? Does the component look and behave as expected in Firefox?</li>
			</ul>
		</li> 
		
		<li>Reflect on the components you might frequently make with this dialog. Are any of them candidates for becoming templates? Use the Beta Feedback section to nominate the ones you think would be useful to a broad audience of prototypers.  Include a link to a spec or working sample if you have one.</li>
		
		<li>Open the dialog and click the '?' tab. Read the help presented there. If you feel something is missing or not covered well, enter feedback about it.</li>
		
		
		
		<li>Visit the <b>Beta Feedback</b> tab and report your findings
			<ul>
				<li>Enter a separate bug for each interaction and visual issue you've noted.  </li>
				<li>Remember to tag each feedback entry appropriately so we can search on it.</li>
				<li>Feedback is due on Tuesday, Noon PT.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
